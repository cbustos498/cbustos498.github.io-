A hero of few words and incredible strength, the Hulk has long been pursued by those who want to use his immense power for their own purposes, or by those who thought the Jade Giant's anger was too dangerous to be controlled. Now, as a member of the Avengers, Hulk helps smash the unimaginable threats that no Hero could face alone, hoping to at least prove to the world that he is the strongest HERO there is!</p>
